CEBS:X1	Activated partial thromboplastin time, activity	APTT	F	Clinical Chemistry	Endpoint	activated partial thromboplastin time assay			averaging data transformation	concentration value specification		coagulation	The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or APTT) measures the efficacy of both the intrinsic and the common coagulation pathways. Blood is mixed with oxalate which arrests coagulation by binding calcium. In th
CEBS:X2	Alanine aminotransferase, activity		F	Clinical Chemistry	Endpoint	analyte assay	blood specimen	alanine aminotransferase 1	k-means clustering	concentration value specification	U/L, IU/L	liver disease	Spectrophotometric determination of alanine amino transferase level (Serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, SGPT); increased level in serum an indication of hepatotoxicity
CEBS:X3	Albumin	alanine transaminase, ALT, ALAT	F	Clinical Chemistry	Endpoint	analyte assay	urine specimen		averaging data transformation	concentration value specification	g/dL	immunoglobulin production	The ratio of albumin to globulin (A/G ratio) is calculated from values obtained by direct measurement of total protein and albumin. It represents the relative amounts of albumin and globulins. A low A/G ratio may reflect overproduction of globulins (such as seen in multiple myeloma or autoimmune diseases) or underproduction of albumin (such as occurs with cirrhosis) or selective loss of albumin from the circulation (as occurs with nephrotic syndrome). A high A/G ratio suggests underproduction of immunoglobulins (as may be seen in some genetic deficiencies and in some leukemias).  (Source: http://www.mlsstjames.com/pages/tests/albumen.htm)
CEBS:X4	Albumin to globulin, ratio	A/G Ratio	F	Clinical Chemistry	Measurement	analyte assay		serum albumin		concentration value specification	g/dL	Dehydration	Spectrophotometric determination of albumin level; indication of liver or kidney disorder and neutritional level;  Low albumin levels can suggest liver disease. Other liver enzyme tests are ordered to determine exactly which type of liver disease.Low albumin levels can reflect diseases in which the kidneys cannot prevent albumin from leaking from the blood into the urine and being lost. In this case, the amount of albumin (or protein) in the urine also may be measured.Low albumin levels can also be seen in inflammation, shock, and malnutrition.Low albumin levels may also suggest conditions in which your body does not properly absorb and digest protein (like Crohn's disease or sprue) or in which large volumes of protein are lost from the intestines.High albumin levels usually reflect dehydration.(source: http://www.mlsstjames.com/pages/tests/albumin.htm)
CEBS:X5	Alkaline phosphatase, activity		F	Clinical Chemistry	Endpoint	analyte assay		alkaline phosphatase, tissue-nonspecific isozyme	k-means clustering	concentration value specification	U/L, IU/L		Spectrophotometric determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the blood. ALP is made mostly in the liver and in bone with some made in the intestines and kidneys. It also is made by the placenta of a pregnant woman.  The liver makes more ALP than the other organs or the bones. Some conditions cause large amounts of ALP in the blood. These conditions include rapid bone growth (during puberty), bone disease (osteomalacia or Paget's disease), or a disease that affects how much calcium is in the blood (hyperparathyroidism), or damaged liver cells.

CEBS:X6	Aspartate aminotransferase, activity	ALP	F	Clinical Chemistry	Endpoint	analyte assay		aspartate aminotransferase, cytoplasmic	averaging data transformation	concentration value specification	U/L	liver disease	Spectrophotometric determination of aspartate amino transferase level (Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, SGOT); increased level in serum an indication of hepatotoxicity.
